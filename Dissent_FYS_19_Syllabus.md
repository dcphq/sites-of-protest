# **DISSENT: SITES OF PROTEST IN THE DIGITAL AGE**

## ****Freshman Year Seminar (SEMN-101-01)****
## ****Syllabus, Fall Quarter 2019**

MWF 11:55AM - 01:10PM, Dewing Hall, Room 304
Professor: Dimitris C. Papadopoulos
Office: Olds Upton Building 305E
Office hours: Friday, 2-4 pm and by appointment 





## COURSE DESCRIPTION

Dissent, in its different forms, has shaped history and continues to claim ground for theory and action, in increasingly urgent ways, in the digital age. New technologies of surveillance, discrimination, and oppression emerge and digitally enabled injustices and forms of violence and inequality, (re-) appear often continuing past legacies of colonialism and exploitation. At the same time, new sites and platforms for subversive voices and practices are created and imagined in response. In this course, we will map these forms and spaces of oppression, violence, and inequality, but also the emerging sites of protest, resistance, and disobedience. In doing so we will think about the condition - as both a mode of thinking and praxis- of being a dissident and its new dangers and possibilities in our globalized world. From the Arab Spring to the Black Lives Matter movement and from Standing Rock to refugee camps in Europe we will explore different sites and case studies to talk about, among other things, data, software and surveillance, hashtags and digital protest, new forms of activism, solidarity, and mobilization, the "digital subaltern", feminist, anti-racist, anti-colonial technologies and indigenous media, or alternative, counter-cartographies of neighborhoods and cities. We will engage with theoretical texts but also experiment with digital tools as a means of exploring critical concepts but also their real-life complexities and implications. By the end of the class, we will reach a deeper understanding of different forms of dissent and disobedience and a good basis from which to think critically about digital spaces and cultures. No prior knowledge or experience with coding, software or digital tools is required.

## COURSE GOALS

### Learning objectives

Our seminar is a discussion and writing-focused class that will introduce students to forms and notions of dissent, protest, and resistance as well as to other key concepts in understanding society and culture while, at the same time, helping build key skills in doing research, critically thinking about concepts and ideas, forming and clearly presenting argument in writing and in discussion. By the end of the quarter, students should be able to use with confidence and in nuanced ways key concepts relating to dissent and protest in different social and cultural contexts, explain them and discuss them using examples in a clear way both in discussions and in writing (see below). 

### **Writing Competencies** 

The First-Year Seminar faculty has established the following goals for fostering writing competencies that will help prepare students for writing in discipline-specific courses in the major and, eventually, for writing the SIP. We hope that every first-year student will develop greater competency in these areas:



<u>Achieving clarity through revision</u>  



- stating and developing a thesis
- writing coherent sentences and well-developed paragraphs
- using correct grammar and mechanics
- being conscious of overall structure and impact
- becoming proficient at editing and proofreading
  writing frequently to gain fluency
- expressing ideas directly and economically



<u>Constructing an argument using evidence</u>



-  understanding the difference between opinion, argument, and evidence, and becoming aware of which of the three serves the writing project at hand
-  synthesizing others’ ideas with one’s own
- using sources to support ideas and positions
- using quoted materials effectively and correctly



<u>Gaining experience in research strategies</u>

-   understanding why doing research is important
- learning how to do research, beginning with the earliest stages
- putting newly gained knowledge and skills into practice
-  working as independent scholars and contributing to  scholarly discourse throughout college and beyond



<u>Cultivating an authentic and versatile style of written communication</u>

- discovering one’s own way into material

- making deliberate choices about structure, style, and voice, with a distinct awareness of audience, context and impact
  writing in a natural, straightforward style

-  demonstrating or developing authenticity and ownership of the work

  

## **KEY COURSE COMPONENTS AND ACTIVITIES**

### **Beyond Google: College Research Workshop.**

Our Seminar will participate in a workshop intended to help you develop and improve your research skills that enhance your development as an independent scholar. Your work will be part of a focused class project. Our workshop is scheduled for **Monday, October 14** during seminar hours. Details and guidelines will be provided in class. 



### **First-Year Forums**

First-Year Forums are intended to help entering K students continue their academic and personal growth. They are interactive, intentionally developmental, focused on learning, and built on aspects of the K-Plan. The Forums fall into five groups:

-    Group 1:  Social Justice and Civic Engagement 
-    Group 2:  Intercultural Understanding
-    Group 3:  Personal Decision-Making and Habits
-    Group 4:  Career and Professional Development
-    Group 5: Academic Success and Independent Scholarship

All first-year students are required to attend one Forum in each group. Many attend more. If students do not attend at least one forum in each group, two percentage points for each Forum missed will be deducted from the final Seminar grade (see “Grading and Evaluation.”)



## **COURSE MATERIALS****

### **Recommended books:**

### **Other readings and materials:**

- All weekly readings and class materials discussed in class
- All articles, book sections, class presentations, discussion board posts, videos and media links uploaded on Moodle.

** Readings, chapter books, website links, videos or other materials will be provided by me or uploaded on Moodle on a weekly basis. **

## **COURSE POLICIES**

### **Staying up-to-date:** 

Check your email and Moodle regularly for class announcements or schedule changes. Keep up with the class schedule and the class syllabus. This syllabus, along with course assignments and due dates, is subject to change. It is the student’s responsibility to check for corrections or updates to the syllabus online. Any changes will be clearly noted on Moodle.

### **Contact and communication:**

My office hours are Friday, 2-4 pm. If office hours don’t work for you email me to schedule an appointment. I will be available to talk and work with each one of you. I plan to have a writing session (20 - 30 minutes) with each student to give feedback on drafts and help improve your writing. Email me if you need help or have questions about the class. Use your K College email account, not personal accounts. 

### **Preparation, participation and discussion:**

This class welcomes contributions from everyone and promotes discussion, exchange of ideas, and collaboration. You are expected to: 

- be familiar with class readings and materials uploaded on Moodle and as defined in our class schedule on a weekly basis and come to class prepared to engage in critical and meaningful discussions as a facilitator, presenter or participant.
- keep an open mind for different views, be patient and attentive to all contributions in discussions and contribute with your own views and ideas. Offensive language or personal insults will not be acceptable. Be ready to exchange ideas and contribute your own arguments and perspectives in collaborative, team work.
- post regularly on the class blog following the class schedule as structured by topic and/or prompt. Blog posts are part of our class discussions. Your grade will be calculated on a post/no-post basis assessing your participation throughout the term. Individual posts will not be evaluated. Posting in response to all prompts guarantees a 100% score.

### **Absences:****

Only three unexcused absences are allowed without penalty (for any additional absences you need to provide appropriate documentation); two tardies will count as one absence. Your overall grade will be lowered one full letter grade for each additional absence. Missing five or more course meetings will result in an automatic failing grade.

### **Preparing and submitting writing assignments**

Do not wait until the last moment to work on class readings and materials. Class material is grouped by topic in a way that encourages discussion across different media and sources (e.g. academic papers, documentaries, blog posts, online resources). You will need time to familiarize yourselves with this material in order to be able to draw links and connections and contribute with you own arguments and reactions to class discussions.

- Submit all assigned work on time. All papers must be submitted as email attachments (please use the pdf file format) on the due date by 11 pm. **A deduction of a grade per day for every day up to a week will be applied to late papers.** No papers will be accepted after that. 
- All papers must be in 12-point Times New Roman, Arial or Calibri font, double-spaced with 1-inch margins and pages numbered. Save your paper as a pdf file.
- Submit your own original work. Plagiarism = failing grade. Consult K College's rules and policies about academic dishonesty: https://reason.kzoo.edu/studev/policies/dishonest/ 
- Use quotation marks and proper bibliographic references when citing the work of others. Go to https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html for a quick guide to Chicago-style citations. 



### **Using citations**

Use quotation marks and proper bibliographic references when citing the work of others. Go to https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html for a quick guide to Chicago-style citations. All submitted work should follow this style guide. 

### **Academic Honesty**

This course operates under the College Honor System. When you borrow an idea, express the idea in your own words, thus thinking it through and making it your own, and acknowledge the source of the idea in a note, or, in certain situations, use the exact words of the source in quotation marks and acknowledge with a note. Ideas raised in class are part of the public domain and, therefore, sources of the ideas need not be acknowledged. Plagiarism = failing grade (also see “Preparing and submitting writing assignments” section. For the full policy, see https://reason.kzoo.edu/studev/policies/dishonest/ 


### **Accessibility and Accommodations**

If you anticipate or experience any sort of physical or academic barriers based on disability, or if there is any course content or material that is not fully accessible to you, feel free to let me know so that we can discuss options and make adjustments, as needed. Kalamazoo College is committed to making every effort to providing reasonable accommodations. If you want to discuss your overall needs for accommodation at the College, please direct questions to the Associate Dean of Students Office, (269) 337-7209.

### **Learning Commons**

The Learning Commons is a network of peer support available to help you with a variety of skills and disciplines. The Writing Center, Research Consultant Center, and Center for New Media Design are on the first floor of Upjohn Library. I encourage you to use them early and often and I will be available to help with any questions you may have. You can find more information about each of these centers here: https://reason.kzoo.edu/learningcommons/ 



### **Electronic devices**

The use of electronic devices is allowed in class as long as it is related to class activities (accessing material online, note taking). 

## **EVALUATION AND GRADING**

### **Evaluation:**

- **Attendance and participation:** you are expected to participate in class discussions and activities on a regular basis in any way you feel most comfortable with (real-time in-class discussions, group work, written questions and feedback). Attending our “Beyond Google Research Workshop” and at least one First Year Forum event is considered part of your class participation and will be evaluated as such.
- **One Class Discussion Facilitation:** each student (either individually or with a classmate) is expected to facilitate one class discussion during the quarter. The facilitators should share an overview or facilitation plan (300-500 words; 1-2 pages) at least one day prior to the day they are expected to facilitate. The overview/facilitation plan needs to include key arguments of the readings, two to three discussion questions, as well as the facilitator’s critical reflections on the questions raised in the text. Facilitators are strongly encouraged to incorporate outside materials, including visual resources and prepare discussion questions that will motivate the engagement and active participation of their classmates. The discussion facilitation session is expected to last approximately half an hour. 
- **Blog posts:** we will be using the class blog for weekly discussions. You are expected to post a short (2-3 paragraphs or 250-300 words) response (by directly responding to a question, or replying to other student posts) on a weekly basis. Your post will be in response to a prompt related to a class reading or material according to the topics defined in the class schedule. The blog posts should include references and short quotations from class readings and materials. You are expected to critically reflect on class readings, discussions and materials and make connections to key concepts, other readings, and resources. Posts will be evaluated on a “posted/not-posted” basis. The grade will be calculated based on overall activity. For example, if you have a post for every single prompt/question, your score will be 100. All weekly blog posts need to be on Moodle on the due date by 11 pm. **A deduction of a grade per day for every day up to a week will be applied to late blog posts.** Blog posts over a week late will not be accepted.
- **Response papers:** response papers are meant to provide a critical reflection on course readings and materials in response to specific questions. Response papers should be 3-4 pages (700-1000 words, double spaced, Times New Roman, Arial or Calibri 12) long. There will be 3 response papers assigned in the quarter. **A deduction of a grade per day for every day up to a week will be applied to late papers.** No papers will be accepted after that.
- **Final paper:** in your final paper you are expected to engage deeper and in a critical way with a certain aspect or issue (of you choice) we will be discussing in class. You will need to deliver an extensive text (7-8 pages) (2000 - 2,500 words, double spaced, Times New Roman, Arial or Calibri 12) that will include references, and quotations from class readings and materials as well as from other sources. The final paper can be submitted in one of the following formats: 1) essay 2) extensive review of a reading or material 3) video, sound or mixed digital storytelling media with narrative or commentary of at least 2000 words.

For grading purposes, coursework is distributed as follows:

- Attendance and participation: 15 %
- Blog posts: 15 % 
- Discussion facilitation: 15 %
- Response papers: 30 %
